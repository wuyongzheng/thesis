\subsection{Case Studies}
\label{sec:lviz-study}

The following case studies show how \code{lviz} can be used to
understand system behavior and to solve system or application problems.
We first use a well understood task, file copying,
to familiarise the reader with VDP.
We then use a software compilation example to show how VDP can
be used for software failure diagnosis.
We use two visualizations on whole system traces to understand
how the operating system works and examine performance problems.
Lastly, we use VDP to examine performance problems in a browser benchmark.
These examples also illustrate that the VDP visualization is highly
customizable and in practice, one could use many different visualizations
on the same trace.

% In order to demonstrate the potential and power of visualizing system traces,
% we have developed a visualization tool VDP using an extension of
% dotplots \cite{dnadp}.
% Dotplots were used to show sequence similarity in
% DNA \cite{dnadp} and music \cite{audio}.
% Our VDP dotplots (or simply VDP for both the visualization and tool)
% extends the basic dotplot to get a flexible visualization
% which can be tailored to visualize different kinds of behavior.
% Furthermore, VDP uses a number of novel extensions geared towards
% understanding software behavior whereas traditional uses of dotplots
% are for showing sequence similarity.

The notation Bar $n$ refers to the $n$th barcode.
The configuration of each visualization is described in the corresponding
figure caption.
