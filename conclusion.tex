This chapter concludes this thesis.
We summarize the contributions of this thesis in Section~\ref{sec:concl-summary},
and discuss some future directions in Section~\ref{sec:future}.

\section{Summary of the Thesis}
\label{sec:concl-summary}

In this thesis, we propose our monitoring frameworks: LBox and WinResMon.
The information collected by them can be used to solve many problems including
software comprehension, fault diagnosis and system security.
Based on the frameworks, we developed two visualizations: module dependency
visualization and \code{lviz}.
As the frameworks are resource-based, we can easily adapt them to control
the access of resources in system and apply them on system security.
Our binary integrity system prevents loading of untrusted binary by monitoring
file access in the operating system.
To detect malware when the operating system kernel is possibly compromised,
we correlate information gathered from external sensors and network routers.

\paragraph{LBox}
We show our user-level logging framework LBox.
