\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{sec:binint-conc}

We have presented a binary security model which caters to the
dynamic use of binaries within the software life cycle
while protecting against attacks in default mode
and giving isolation between software domains in install mode.
Our prototype is efficient and usable while
protecting a broad range of binary loading/execution mechanisms in Windows.
We found our system to be mostly transparent in usage on typical
Windows software throughout its software lifecycle.
Thus, BinInt is a practical solution
which gives a good tradeoff between usability and security
to protect binaries on Windows.
Comparing to UAC, we believe that our model provides better protection
especially for user-owned binaries, while having better user experience
in terms of interference (security prompt).
Our model can also be combined with other security mechanisms such
as file system access control and user privilege separation.
